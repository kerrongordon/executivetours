Get-A- Way for the day as we escape to some of Grenada’s most exotic beaches. Imagine the cool Caribbean Sea breeze hugging your face, while the fine refreshing sand kisses your feet.

Hop on and hop off at four of Grenada’s must-see beach attractions. Black Bay Beach hosts attractive black sand which hugs the surrounding coastline area. If you are lucky, you just might be right on time to witness the main event over at Levera Beach, home to the Leather Back Turtles which seasonally stops by to lay their eggs.

The Bath- Way Beach, popularly known for its large natural coral reef wall, which stands tall as a protector against the Atlantic Sea, making the Beach a safe and calm area for bathing. Top it all off with the Hidden Gem, BBC Beach, formerly known as Morne Rouge Bay, which sits gracefully to the south of the island.
