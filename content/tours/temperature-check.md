Are you a lover of nature? Do you enjoy a good harsh or hike? Then we got just the right combination for you. Located in the middle of the rainforest reserves, sits one of the wonders of the islands, the seven sister’s waterfall.

After an approximate 15 minutes hike, enjoy the breath-taking scenery as the water cascades down the rocks, settling below to form inviting pools of water you can enjoy a refreshing swim at. Tucked away in the lush mountainous area not too far away from the seven sister’s waterfall, is the Adelphi Falls.

Venture along the scenic trail for about 15 minutes before you arrive at the marvelous shallow pool laying gracefully below the falls as the water dances down the stoned walls. The adventure continues as we journey to the exotic Clabony Sulphur Spring. Unlike most natural hot pools, this hot spring does not smell of acrid sulphur, and the rich sulphur is popularly used for exfoliation and skin softening, definitely a bonus thrown in there.
