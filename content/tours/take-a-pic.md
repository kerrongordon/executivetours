Tired of the hustle and bustle of the city? Why not venture up to the north of the island to the boardwalk which extends into the tranquil waters of Levera Pond.

This wooden structure is surrounded by a flourishing mangrove reserve that is home to many wild species. Dangle your feet in the welcoming water of the pond as fish jump to extend greetings, or update your Instagram with the scenic views. Whatever you decide, spending time at the boardwalk is always worth the while, and lets you feel in touch with nature.

Grenada is home to many beautiful sunsets, but nothing beats those viewed from Victoria, better known as Sunset city as the locals call it. The golden, auburn rays of the sun as it sets beyond the horizon is a site to behold. The reflection of the rays on the water is quite pleasing to the eye and it is indeed a beautiful way to end the day.
