Journey up through the natural rain forest reserves. Feel the cool mist on your face as you inhale the pure air. Feast your eyes on the lush vegetation, and the tall pine trees with endemic fern in between. Indulge in the music sung by the birds, and enjoy the beautiful site of the mona monkeys swinging from branch to branch.

Stop at the highest motor point, “1910”, as you enjoy picturesque views of the south of the island. To top it off, our next stop takes us to the largest crater lake on the island rumored to be bottomless. Look at the mist as it descends on the mountains, feed the fishes as they anxiously swim beneath your feet. Feel in touch with nature as you embark on the various trails surrounding the landscape.

From St. Andrew, we journey on to St. Patrick, one of the most historic parishes and home to the other 2 crater Lakes: Lake Antoine and Levera Pond. Due to the mass mangrove, Lake Antoine is inaccessible, so we shall enjoy the calming bird’s eye view from up above the pond.

Just about 15 mins from Lake Antoine is Levera Pond also surrounded by a mangrove reserve. Sit on the wooden dock and calm your mind with the pristine water, or ascend to top to enjoy the orange sunset from the tower.
