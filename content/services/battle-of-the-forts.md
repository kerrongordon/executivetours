Boast of your visit to Fort George, Grenada’s oldest fort which sits mighty at the hill top, 2 minutes outside the main city. Enjoy a striking 360 view from Fort Frederick, which showcases picture perfect ocean views, and magnificent mountainous ranges, clothed with lush vegetation and local homes.
