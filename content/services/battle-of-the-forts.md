Breathe in Grenada’s rich history as you stroll through these antique stone fortifications, which hosts astonishing bird’s eye views of the Harbour, the town of St. George, Grand Anse Beach, Point Saline, and so much more.

Boast of your visit to Fort George, Grenada’s oldest fort which sits mighty at the hill top, 2 minutes outside the main city. Enjoy a striking 360 view from Fort Frederick, which showcases picture perfect ocean views, and magnificent mountainous ranges, clothed with lush vegetation and local homes.

Stroll through Fort Matthew, the largest fort on the island which houses ancient bathrooms, cells, and underground tunnels.
