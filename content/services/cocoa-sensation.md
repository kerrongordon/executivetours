Savour the dark and healthy, pure pleasures of Grenada’s luxury organic cocoa products, as we escape to the estates and factories to witness the production process. Get the opportunity to see the cocoa in its natural habitat, break a pod and enjoy the delicious fruit while in the beautiful tropics.

At the Belmont estate you can stroll through the plantation grounds which also hosts an eatery, museum, and cocoa making facilities where they produce their own chocolate, cocoa powder, cocoa balls, and cocoa butter. The sugar rush continues as we head on over to the first “Tree to Bar” Chocolate company, the Grenada Chocolate factory.

Next, we journey over to the Diamond chocolate factory where you are free to wonder through the estate and enjoy the beauty of the process of the cocoa being grown and dried. Get your hands covered in chocolate as you engage in the chocolate making process if you so desire, as we visit also the Crayfish Bay Chocolate Factory, the Tri-Island Chocolate Factory and the Chocolate Museum.
