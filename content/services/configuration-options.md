To see working configuration examples, you can [start from a template](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/start-with-a-template) or check out the [CMS demo site](https://cms-demo.netlify.com/). (No login required: click the login button and the CMS will open.) You can refer to the demo [configuration code](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/blob/master/dev-test/config.yml) to see how each option was configured.

You can find details about all configuration options below. Note that [YAML syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML#Basic_components) allows lists and objects to be written in block or inline style, and the code samples below include a mix of both.
