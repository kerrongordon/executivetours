To get started using Git Gateway on a site, first [enable Identity service](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/identity/#enable-identity-in-the-ui), then go to **Site settings > Identity > Services > Git Gateway**, and select **Enable Git Gateway**. This will automatically provision your site so that Identity users have access to Git Gateway’s selected endpoints on your site’s connected GitHub.com or GitLab.com-hosted repository.
