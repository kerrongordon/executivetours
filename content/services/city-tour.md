A holistic experience welcoming you with open arms to embark on a journey through the unique city of St. George’s. Enjoy majestic panoramic views of the horse-shoe-shaped harbor, the pristine Grand Anse Beach, and so much more, as Fort George awards you the opportunity to capture post card worthy pictures from Grenada’s oldest Fort, formerly known as Fort Royal. For our lovers of chocolate, we’ve got a treat for your taste buds.

Ever wondered where your chocolate came from? Stroll through Grenada’s Chocolate Museum and witness the answer first hand, while enjoying a display of the history of Chocolate, and all products made from Grenada’s cocoa bean.

The excitement continues as we visit one of the oldest churches within the city. Then we head on over to the Bayside of the city, Melville street, which leads us over to the Harbour side of the city, the horse-shoe-shaped carenage, which sits on the opposite side of the First City, Port Louis.
