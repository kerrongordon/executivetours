Before rebranded as Pure Grenada, this tropical island was formerly known as ‘The Island of Spice.’ Grenada is widely known for its rich spices enjoyed worldwide.

This tour awards you the opportunity to stroll through the Laura Herb and Spice Garden, while enjoying an educational tour about the various trees, herbs and spices grown on the island. The fun continues as we venture over to the De La Grenade Factory, here you would enjoy the marvelous flavors of Grenada.

Experience first-hand the process of producing Jam, Jelly and so much more from our Nutmeg Pericarp. Now to top it all off, we stop by the St. George’s Spice Market as we explore the wide variety of spices and souvenirs, from different farm lands and vendors, throughout the entire island.
