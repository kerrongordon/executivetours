Entice your taste buds as you explore the wonders of the Flavours of Grenada’s Locally produced Rums. Journeying to the North of the island to River Antoine Rum Distillery, here you will experience up close and personal, the only authentic fully functional water driven mill on the island.

Experience rum making the old fashion way. The excitement continues as we venture over to the Westerhall Rum Distillery where you will tour the estate and view the ruins and museum. The rum tale continues as we head over to what once was a sugar foundation, the remains are still kept around on exhibition, now known as the Clarke’s Court Rum Distillery.

Here, we sample the wide variety of rum produced at this distillery, setting the mood for all the drinks we are about to devour as we head off to Bar Hopping.
